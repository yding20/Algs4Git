# Algs4Git
1. First commit : Index we use to refer the grid[][]is sill from 0 ~ n-1
		  Still use brute force to check whehter the first row and last row are connected, N^2 much too slow!

2. Second commit: Index use 1~n now. Add the virtual bottom and virtual top, much faster now. Sitll use UFWithFindMax now!

3. Third commit: Compatible with import edu.princeton.cs.algs4.WeightedQuickUnionUF, however, backwash seems happen in this case. 86% coursera 

4. Fix corner problem accodring to coursera report, backwash still there.
